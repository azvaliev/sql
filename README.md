![Screenshot Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/azvaliev/sql/master/assets/main.png)

- One CLI for Postgres and MySQL
- Easy multiline editing of queries
- Unified command to view table schema. `DESCRIBE X`
- Display results in a scrollable table, no wrapping


## Installation

### Via golang toolchain

#### Prerequisites

- Need go version 1.22 or greater
- Make sure your go bin is in your path.
    Easy way to add that is `export PATH="$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH"`

#### Command

```bash
go install github.com/azvaliev/sql@latest
```

## Usage

Specify what kind of database you're connecting to via `-mysql` or `-psql` flags (required).
For additional arguments see `sql --help`

```bash
sql (-mysql OR -psql) (... additional options) --database=example
```

### Application Usage

In the query text area, type any SQL statement followed by `;` and hit enter to send the query. Results will be displayed in the above space on the screen.

The text area is multi-line and you can use either the mouse or arrow keys to navigate through the text area.

#### Unified DESCRIBE, SHOW TABLES, SHOW INDEXES command

Several commands from MySQL have been ported to this CLI for convinience

- `DESCRIBE X` command for easily viewing details about a table. See [MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/show-columns.html) for details
- `SHOW TABLES` command for easily all tables in the current database. It just will return a list of all tables in the current databse
- `SHOW INDEXES FROM X` command for viewing indexes on a specific table.

#### Handling overflowing results

When editing the text area, one can scroll the results section using `ctrl` or `option` (MacOS) + corresponding arrow for direction to scroll.

Example: To scroll results up, (`ctrl` or `option`) + `â†‘`

#### Copy query result

When you run a query and it is succesfully, at the top right on the table you'll see a `Copy as CSV` or `Copy as JSON` button, to copy the table results in the desired format

##### JSON

#### Copy cell result

Occasionally, one may want to copy the output of a particular cell in the result table, especially for use in subsequent queries.

Just click on the cell you want to copy and it will copy to the clipboard.

#### Safe Mode (MySQL)

MySQL has an option called safe mode, you can enable this feature using the `-safe` flag when running this application. It helps prevent unbounded update/delete operations

See [MySQL Documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/mysql-tips.html#safe-updates) for more details
